Dips:
To summarize, dips are the best when you **rock back and forth** or **lean forward the entire time**, but make sure to do a partial range of motion to keep you safer in the long run. **Extremely wide dips** are not effective, and **barbell dips** with your hands slightly wider than shoulder width are a good option, but they may bias towards the outer low pecs.
