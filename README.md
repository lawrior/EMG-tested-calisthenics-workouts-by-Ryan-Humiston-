## Here’s Why Your Lower Chest Sucks…

Dips:
"To summarize, dips are the best when you **rock back and forth** or **lean forward the entire time**, but make sure to do a partial range of motion to keep you safer in the long run. **Extremely wide dips** are not effective, and **barbell dips** with your hands slightly wider than shoulder width are a good option, but they may bias towards the outer low pecs."

### Barbell dips and Old-fashioned dips and Close grip push-ups
"First up, we have **cable straight bar push downs** versus the **dip variation***(barbell dips)*. I'm going to do on the Smith machine. Between these two, it's a **tough call in terms of limiting long head activation** and **getting more out of your lateral head.** Then the **dip** variation is a **clear winner**, but it really comes down to what you believe is most important in terms of growth. If you believe you should fully stretch and relax the muscle each time before you contract, then you should do press downs. If you think that's dumb and who cares about fully stretching and relaxing the muscle, it's just time under tension, then do the dip variation. **The dip variation is an uglier contraction, but the lateral head is also trying to stabilize the entire time so you don't fall on your face.** **It is a more intense contraction**, even though you're going to look like an idiot."

"Next up, we have good **old-fashioned dips** versus **close grip push-ups**.
This one is easy to tell just by looking at the signals themselves. The close grip push-up looks tough and has a fairly good contraction, but dips Holy Hell *have a  much more intense contraction.*"
